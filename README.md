# My ePortfolio

## About This Project
This is my personal ePortfolio, a website I created to showcase my skills, achievements, and projects. It’s simple, clean, and designed to make a great first impression. This project helped me practice my web development skills and learn how to bring ideas to life on the web.

## Technologies Used
Here are the main technologies I used:
- **HTML**: To structure the content.
- **CSS**: For all the styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and make the site more dynamic.
